<p>I have another weekend driving holiday planned in the next few weeks and my fiancee has requested Family Guy episodes on the iPod for the trip. Now that I know how to do it, I figure I better get started because there are a <a href="http://www.tv.com/family-guy/show/348/episode.html" target="_blank">lot of episodes</a>.</p> <p>This time I decided to try Vrata's suggestion of <a href="http://www.dvdfab.com/" target="_blank">DVDFab</a> instead of the Videora software I used <a href="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,b501336c-366b-47fe-b698-1c5ee2df5bac.aspx" target="_blank">last time</a>.&nbsp;What follows&nbsp;is a very&nbsp;quick summary of my experience with DVDFab.</p> <p>Benefits:</p> <ul> <li>Does not require separate DVD ripping software.</li> <li>Supports optionally embedding subtitles into the video stream.</li> <li>GUI is very clean and easy to follow.</li> <li>Hasn't crashed yet on Vista x64.</li></ul> <p>Disappointments:</p> <ul> <li>Still insists on running as Administrator.</li> <li>The Platinum version for iPod conversion costs about US$50.</li></ul> <p>In all other ways DVDFab is similar to Videora. Similar conversion times, same resulting file sizes. Support for multiple devices' resolutions and bit rates.</p> <p>If you think you'll be converting quite a lot of DVDs to an iPod compatible format, DVDFab is probably worth the price and you can try the fully-functional 30-day trial yourself to be sure.</p>
