In fact, until he finds a suitable publisher he expects to selling independently for a few months, during which time we might be lucky to pick it up for a "bargain" price.</p>
<p>So far I think&nbsp;NStatic only supports C# 2.0 but there are plans to add support for C# 3.0 features and maybe VB.NET too if the demand is there. I, for one, sure hope that VB support becomes a reality, I think our current suite of software could really benefit from some in depth analysis.</p>
