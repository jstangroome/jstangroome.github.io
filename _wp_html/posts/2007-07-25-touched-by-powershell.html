Today I was asked how to "touch" all files in a folder in Windows to set the Modified timestamp to now. If I was asked about the Created timestamp I would have suggested to copy the files to a new folder and use the copies which will have a new Created timestamp. Unfortunately Windows doesn't seem to have an easy way to edit the Modified timestamp.

Thankfully, everyone who has Windows also has PowerShell, or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx" target="_blank">should have</a>, or should <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/powershell.mspx" target="_blank">upgrade their OS</a>. With PowerShell, touching files is easy:

<span style="font-size:11px;color:black;font-family:Courier New;background-color:transparent;">Get-ChildItem <span style="font-size:11px;color:red;font-family:Courier New;background-color:transparent;">*</span> <span style="font-size:11px;color:red;font-family:Courier New;background-color:transparent;">|</span> <span style="font-size:11px;color:red;font-family:Courier New;background-color:transparent;">%</span> { $_.LastWriteTime <span style="font-size:11px;color:red;font-family:Courier New;background-color:transparent;">=</span> [DateTime]::Now }</span>
