<div><a href="http://www.felicepollano.com/">Felice Pollano</a> has just released the <a href="http://www.felicepollano.com/PermaLink,guid,1c863e69-1b56-4cfa-a60b-203e1127b8bd.aspx">first version</a> of the new Deblector addin for debugging within <a href="http://www.aisto.com/Roeder/DotNet/">Reflector</a>. It's only alpha at the moment and has some obvious bugs but it is very promising. In the past I have looked at having a Virtual PC with a hacked rebuild of the core framework with debugging enabled. Now I can step into framework code just as easily within the familar Reflector interface. I don't have much experience with IL so I was a little confused at first when multiple lines of IL seemed to execute at once but I quickly realised they all applied to method call setup. I suspect, if possible, we may even be able step through the framework viewed in our chosen language. Keep an eye on this one.</div>
