&lt;![CDATA[<p>My first attempt to organise a <a href="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,49228f2f-6a59-43f8-a82c-dd36b4e1b3bf.aspx" target="_blank">dinner for developers</a> in Adelaide exceeded my expectations. Everyone seemed to have a good time and expressed an interest to do it again... we tentatively agreed on January.</p>
<p>This time, I'd like to re-invite <a href="http://blog.adamant.com.au/" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://blog.spencen.com/" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="http://paulturner.is-a-geek.com/" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/robfarley/" target="_blank">guests</a> who were unable to attend in November, and try to schedule an available time for everyone. I'd also like to get feedback on the choice of venue.</p>
<p>Last time I chose Cafe Buongiorno because it is located centrally in the CBD, offers separate accounts to avoid <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=table+banking" target="_blank">table-banking</a>, and has convenient parking and public transport. Most people like pizza and pasta too. I don't want to bore people with the same restaurant every time so I'd like to hear suggestions for alternatives, but if you all like the cafe it can stay.</p>
<p>Also, I chose a Saturday evening last time so people didn't have to rush from work to get to the dinner but if Sunday or a weekday would be better, or perhaps a lunch-time event interests you, pass on your comments.</p>
<p>Finally, if you know any other developers who may be interested in attending, put them in touch with me and I'll ensure they get invited.</p>]]&gt;
