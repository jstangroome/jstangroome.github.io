<p>I tried using <a href="http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx" target="_blank">Rhino.Mocks</a> in production test code for the first time the other day. I downloaded the latest version from Oren Eini's website, unzipped it into source control, and added a reference to my project.</p> <p>I wrote a quick test utilising the interface mocking features and hit Ctrl+Alt+X to run the test. SecurityException! The message, which I've since forgotten, was complaining that the referenced assembly (ie Rhino.Mocks.dll) could not be loaded.</p> <p>A quick Google provided the solution, you need to ensure you've unblocked any files you have downloaded from the Internet or a network machine. Now I'm happily mocking away.</p>
