Firstly, why?

* Web Application projects, Azure projects, and presumably several others already create ready-to-deploy packages in the drop folder
* WPF projects, Windows Forms projects and console projects, etc, drop all their files in the root of the drop folder.
* To do it manually would require following all non-GACed reference assemblies recursively and parsing the project files for files marked as Content or marked for Copy To Output, satellite assemblies, COM references, etc.
* MSBuild already handles this for us, let's leverage it.

How?

* A light touch, avoid changing any system/framework build files, minimise the changes when they are made, keep the changes grouped together, keep them consistent and reusable.
* Based on Jonathon Schuster's answer on the Stack Overflow question below
