Several weeks ago <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/">Richard Banks</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/rbanks54">@rbanks54</a>) coerced me to find time to present to the Australian Virtual Alt.NET User Group between moving house and deploying a new website to production for my current client.

I agreed and with an absurdly short amount of preparation presented to a small group online using Microsoft Live Meeting and a shared PowerShell console window. You can <a href="http://ozalt.net/blog/virtual-alt-net-11-may-09-powershell-and-ngourd/">watch the presentation</a> on the <a href="http://ozalt.net/blog/">Oz Alt.NET Community Blog</a>.

The “slides” and example scripts can be <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/255217/OzVAN-PowerShell.zip">downloaded here</a>.
