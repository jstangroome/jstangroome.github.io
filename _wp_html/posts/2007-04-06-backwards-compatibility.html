&lt;![CDATA[<p>At work we are currently developing a suite of applications that are expected to work on Windows XP and, I assume, eventually Windows Vista. The entire development team refreshed their workstations just after Vista went RTM and was available to MSDN subscribers. At the time Visual Studio 2005 wasn't fully supported in Vista and there were too many unknowns so an executive decision was made to stay with XP on the dev machines. I feel it was the right decision at the time.</p>
<p>However, there was one particular reason for staying with XP that I wasn't sure I could agree with. There was a concern that by developing under Vista we might lose touch with XP and find ourselves developing a product that has accidentally used facilities only available in Vista or that differ in Vista. The result, of course, is that we may lose compatibility with XP and discover the problem too late in development to solve it without large time, effort, or cost consequences.</p>
<p>I have decided to use my blog as a place of discussion for reasons why this concern is, or is not, valid. My bias is that the concern is unnecessary but I invite comments on anything I haven't considered.</p>
<h4>Acceptance Testing</h4>
<p>For each iteration of a product that we produce it goes to our testers to find bugs and usability issues before it can be considering for release. Our testers utilise a clean Windows XP environment inside Virtual PC to perform the suite of tests against the product. Any problems in our software that are specific to XP should be picked up here.</p>
<h4>Visual Studio Limitations</h4>
<p>Visual Studio 2005 was released well before Windows Vista was close to completion. As a result the IDE itself is not aware of any new features in Vista. In fact, it doesn't even fully support all the features introduced in Windows XP, one aspect that comes to mind is correct rendering of 32-bit icons. Any Vista specific features that are used will have be done so explicitly and presumably with prior consideration.</p>
<h4>Framework 3.0</h4>
<p>The new .NET Framework 3.0 features are included out of the box in Vista. Updates have been released for Visual Studio 2005 to provide project items and designers for the new WPF, WCF, and WWF components. However, just as we need to ensure that our XP clients need to install .NET Framework 2.0, version 3.0&nbsp;is supported on XP and Server 2003, and is redistributable via the same methods as 2.0.</p>
<h4>Features Lost</h4>
<p>One of the primary focuses of Windows Vista has been to improve security. Many popular applications have required (or still require) an update to support Vista due to a change in the operating system's default behaviour. I believe there is a greater risk of utilising a Windows XP feature that will break under Vista because security has been tightened or the feature has been removed altogether (anyone still using WinHelp?).</p>
<h4>Practice</h4>
<p>With these points in mind I am in the process of building a Vista 64-bit development machine for the home office. With this configuration I intend to experience first hand what issues there are in terms of application compatibility and problems with the development process itself. Anything I find along the way that supports or disproves my beliefs above will help to decide when the development team should migrate to Vista, if at all.</p>
<p>If you have any experiences yourself with this situation I would appreciate your input.</p>]]&gt;
