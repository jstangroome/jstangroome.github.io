In January I presented at the <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/">Sydney ALT.NET user group</a> about HTTPS, focusing on all the new advancements in this space and some long-held misconceptions too. It was well received so I re-presented it at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Port80-Sydney/">Port80 Sydney meetup</a> in March.

I met Steve Cassidy from Macquarie University who was also presenting at the same Port80 meetup and I was invited to present the talk a third time as a guest lecture to second year Macquarie University Computer Science students on May 4th. The lecture was filmed but is only available to those with a student login. My <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/https-presentation-at-port80-sydney-meetup">slide deck from Port80 is available on SlideShare</a> though.

On May 19th I delivered a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Azure-Sydney-User-Group/events/230501348/">breakfast talk</a> about my experience deploying some of section.io's infrastructure into Azure. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_tRUzerXZw">video of this talk is publicly available</a> and so are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/sectionio-expanding-from-aws-to-azure">the slides</a>.

This year my friend <a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2016-06-01-dddsydney-what-i-learnt-organising-the-conference.html">Aaron lead the organising of the return of the DDD conference in Sydney</a>. I submitted a talk proposal and was fortunate to receive enough votes to earn a speaking slot. So, on Saturday May 28th I presented "Web Performance Lessons" which covered a variety of scenarios I had encountered while improving the performance of other people's websites as part of my job at section.io. The talk was recorded by the conference sponsor <a href="https://tv.ssw.com/">SSW</a> and is <a href="https://tv.ssw.com/6754/web-performance-lessons-from-other-peoples-websites-jason-stangroome-at-ddd-sydney-2016">available to watch here</a>. Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/web-performance-lessons-at-ddd-sydney-may-2016">my slides can be viewed at SlideShare</a>.

At the Port80 meetup in March I also met <a href="https://twitter.com/mbadran">Mo Badran</a> who organises the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Operational-Intelligence/">Operational Intelligence Sydney meetup</a>. Mo asked if I could do a presentation of how section.io handles operations so on Tuesday May 31st I presented "Monitoring at section.io" where I shared a bunch of detail about our tools and processes for operational visibility at section.io, both for the platform itself, and for users of our CDN. Those <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/monitoring-at-sectionio-operational-intelligence-meetup-may-2016">slides are published on SlideShare</a> too.

I'll take a break from speaking in June and instead absorb what other people have to share at the <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity">Velocity conference</a> in Santa Clara and take the opportunity to also check out the new section.io office in Colorado.

I know this blog has been quiet for a while. I have been posting most of my written content over at the <a href="https://www.section.io/blog/">section.io blog</a> lately and will probably continue to blog there more often than here in the near future. Some of my recent posts include:
