<p>I have been encountering code recently that bugs me. Many methods in classes are testing their arguments for null/Nothing and, if true, throwing a new ArgumentNullException. So far, all good. However, the constructor for the new ArgumentNullException is being passed both the name of the argument and also a message string of the form "_paramName_ cannot be null".</p> <p>This is totally redundant. The exception being thrown is an Argument *Null* Exception. That about sums it up. Also, if the constructor is passed the parameter name only the message defaults to "Value cannot be null".</p> <p>Providing a message for an ArgumentNullException requires extra typing, requires maintaining the argument name in three places if it gets renames, and violates FxCop rule <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182187(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">CA1303</a>.</p> <p>Thankfully it turns out it isn't fellow&nbsp;team members&nbsp;doing it. <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/Refactor/" target="_blank">Developer Express' Refactor Pro</a> has a "Create Method Contract" refactoring that is putting the message in.</p>
