<p>Firstly, in <a href="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,9a2ef27f-be0f-4545-a864-521c5d1e5d6b.aspx" target="_blank">my recent post</a> about the new .Net <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetimeoffset(vs.90).aspx" target="_blank">DateTimeOffset</a> class I mentioned that I would love to see the SQL Server team include this type in databases. My wishes <a href="http://dotnetsamplechapters.blogspot.com/2007/06/sql-server-2008-will-have-7-new.html" target="_blank">have been answered</a>, we can expect to see this type and some other very interesting additions in the next CTP/Beta of SQL Server 2008. Unfortunately, all of our clients have bought into SQL Server 2005 and won't be interested in upgrading anytime soon so I'll have to find a new project to try all the new toys.</p> <p>Secondly, also in <a href="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,338eb27b-7af2-4229-9668-6f021e1f3f95.aspx" target="_blank">a recent post</a> I complained about the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.collectionbase.aspx" target="_blank">CollectionBase</a>&nbsp;type being left behind when generics were added to .NET 2.0. I've since discovered the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132398(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Collection&lt;T&gt;</a> class tucked away in the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132396(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">System.Collections.ObjectModel</a> namespace. It doesn't offer all the events that the previous equivalent did but it is inheritable and overridable so it should do the job nicely.&nbsp;I obviously didn't search very hard for it all the other times I looked; very embarrassing.</p>
