<p>It can be expected that for any blog about a difficulty&nbsp;experienced by a user of &nbsp;Windows that the third comment to be posted will recommend the&nbsp;Linux or Mac OS as&nbsp;the solution to the problem. The first two comments preceding the third usually add actual value for other readers of the blog.</p> <p>The theory is not restricted to just Windows and could equally be applied to a language (eg VB), a concept (eg Agile), a product (eg iPod), or any topic with distinct followers and opposers. Obviously, in these cases the suggested solution corresponds to the exchanged topic. For example, an article about VB's failings will be responded to with "You should use C# instead".</p>
