&lt;![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,8257b49e-fc4e-472f-9f5b-a7b2bc2ee0db.aspx" target="_blank">last post</a> about the Adelaide Geek Dinner, I intended to schedule the coming dinner for January. Unfortunately, if I scheduled it for the last weekend in January, that would coincide with the Australia Day long weekend and I imagine several people already have plans.</p>
<p>Therefore, the next dinner will instead be Saturday 2nd February, but once again at Cafe Buongiorno, Rundle Street, starting at 6:30pm. I have sent invitations via email to all the people who attended last time and also to those who couldn't make it.</p>
<p>If you didn't receive an invitation and would like to attend, contact me and I'll arrange it. Please RSVP by Thursday 24th January so I can ensure enough seats will be reserved at the restaurant.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing all the interesting things that have been happening since the November dinner.</p>]]&gt;
