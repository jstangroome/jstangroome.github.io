I recently needed to query the Hyper-V KVP Exchange data for a guest VM to find the currently configured IPv4 address of the VM's network adapter. A quick search of the Internet reveals that the Msvm_KvpExchangeComponent WMI class is the source of this information and there are at least two blog posts that cover it well:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/m2/archive/2010/07/29/how-to-get-the-ip-address-of-a-virtual-machine-from-hyper-v.aspx">How to get the IP address of a virtual machine from Hyper-V</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/taylorb/archive/2012/12/05/customizing-the-key-value-pair-kvp-integration-component.aspx">Customizing The Key Value Pair (KVP) Integration Component</a></li>
</ul>
However, in both of these blogs, the actual data comes back as XML which is then parsed using XPath. The original XML looks something like this:
<pre>&lt;INSTANCE CLASSNAME="Msvm_KvpExchangeDataItem"&gt;
 &lt;PROPERTY NAME="Data" TYPE="string"&gt;
  &lt;VALUE&gt;169.254.103.5&lt;/VALUE&gt;
 &lt;/PROPERTY&gt;
 &lt;PROPERTY NAME="Name" TYPE="string"&gt;
  &lt;VALUE&gt;RDPAddressIPv4&lt;/VALUE&gt;
 &lt;/PROPERTY&gt;
 &lt;PROPERTY NAME="Source" TYPE="uint16"&gt;
  &lt;VALUE&gt;2&lt;/VALUE&gt;
 &lt;/PROPERTY&gt;
&lt;/INSTANCE&gt;</pre>
As soon as I saw this XML I recognised it as the DMTF CIM XML format - the same format that the new PowerShell v3 CIM Cmdlets use to transport CIM instances over HTTP (I believe). If this is the format used by PowerShell, it seemed a reasonable assumption  that PowerShell or the .NET Framework must already have an implementation for deserializing this XML properly so I don't have to code it myself.

With <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/">Reflector</a> in hand, I started my investigation at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.managementbaseobject.gettext.aspx">ManagementBaseObject.GetText</a> which converts to XML but I couldn't find any complementary methods to go the other direction. I then proceeded to look at ManageBaseObject's implementation of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.iserializable.aspx">ISerializable</a> interface and corresponding constructor but that appears to use binary serialization of COM types.

Finally, I turned to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.management.infrastructure.ciminstance(v=vs.85).aspx">CimInstance</a> class and its implementation of ISerializable and discovered the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.management.infrastructure.serialization.cimdeserializer(v=vs.85).aspx">CimDeserializer</a>. Unfortunately the CimDeserializer methods take a byte array as input and I had strings. So assuming round-tripping should work, I looked to the CimSerializer and tried passing it a CimInstance and inspected the byte array that was returned - every second byte is zero, and the rest fit within 7-bits... smells like Unicode.

Taking a small gamble I took the strings from the Msvm_KvpExchangeComponent instance, used System.Text.Encoding.Unicode to convert them to byte arrays and passed them to CimDeserializer.DeserializeInstance. Huzzah! Properly deserialized Msvm_KvpExchangeDataItem instances.

And here is the final PowerShell script to return the items for a given VM name: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jstangroome/6068782">https://gist.github.com/jstangroome/6068782</a>
