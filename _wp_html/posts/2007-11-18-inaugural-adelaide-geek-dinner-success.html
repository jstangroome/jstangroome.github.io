<p>While others were invited but were unfortunately unable to attend, a very friendly and interesting eight people ultimately arrived. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sanrez.com/" target="_blank">Keith Zerna</a>
<li><a href="http://enigmativity.com/blog/" target="_blank">James Chapman-Smith</a>
<li><a href="http://davidgardiner.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">David Gardiner</a>
<li><a href="http://www.paulstovell.net/blog/" target="_blank">Paul Stovell</a>
<li><a href="http://showusyourcode.spaces.live.com/" target="_blank">Darren Neimke</a>
<li><a href="http://www.lgs.sa.gov.au/" target="_blank">Steve Burger</a>
<li><a href="http://www.nervoustych.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jim Burger</a>
<li>and myself.</li></ul>
<p>The evening started at 6:30pm (for most of us ;) and eventually came to a close at around 10:30pm after everyone was quite full from a delicious dinner and meaty conversation. I've uploaded a couple of photos to my Flickr account <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jstangroome/sets/72157603219193801/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I was originally uncertain about trying to organise such an event especially as I had only briefly met some of the guys before and some not at all. I am very glad I did though because I learned a lot, had some good laughs, and made some new friends too.</p>
<p>The response was so good that I plan to arrange another dinner, with a few more people who couldn't make it this time (eg Candy ;). An evening in January 2008 is my goal but this time I'll invite suggestions for venue, date, and anything else that you think might be a good idea.</p>
<p>Watch this blog for more information on the next dinner as it becomes available and if you'd like to be invited, just send me an email or leave a comment here on the blog.</p>]]&gt;
