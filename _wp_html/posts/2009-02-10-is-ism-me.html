In a sad attempt to get blogging again, I am going to start by responding to <a href="http://www.nervoustych.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,826827b3-3f22-47cf-a034-5c127578977c.aspx">this blatant prod</a>. I agree with some of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/7/b62/608">Jim</a>'s answers but to keep it interesting I've selected a disjoint set and <a href="http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Elzar">knocked it up a notch</a>.

I am:

Pragmatic about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655/">dogmatism</a>.

Practicing <a href="http://www.codeassassin.com/dvds.txt">consumerism</a>.

Prone to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeatism">defeatism</a>.

Parodying <a href="http://www.polar.fi/au-en/products/running_multisport/RS200">athleticism</a>.

Proof of <a href="http://xkcd.com/505/">determinism</a>.

To keep it going, the same rule applies: if you've read this then follow suit blogging your own answers, even if you are busy writing your own blog engine.
