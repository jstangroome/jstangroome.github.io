&lt;![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my new blog domain.</p>
<p>I recently decided that I would commit to a more regular blogging schedule. I've kept to my plan for three weeks&nbsp;so far and decided I wanted some more control over my blog than Live Spaces would allow. This site is the result.</p>
<p>There may be lull in the posts while I investigate the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259702.aspx">Live Spaces MetaWeblog API</a> to export my old posts at <a href="http://jasonstangroome.spaces.live.com/">Jason's Thoughts</a> to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BlogML">BlogML</a>&nbsp;then import them to this new site. Hopefully it won't be very long at all and will generate some material worth blogging in the process.</p>
<p>In the mean time, links to&nbsp;my scattering of other content is in the Navigation side bar and I highly recommend&nbsp;my favourite&nbsp;bloggers listed in the Blogroll sidebar.</p>]]&gt;
