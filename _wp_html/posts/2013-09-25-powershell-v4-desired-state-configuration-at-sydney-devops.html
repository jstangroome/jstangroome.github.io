I volunteered to speak about the new Desired State Configuration features in PowerShell 4.0 at the local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/devops-sydney/events/118488952/">DevOps user group in Sydney</a> on September 19th. The technology has a lot of potential but until it is officially released and all the documentation is available, I found some aspects of Desired State Configuration difficult to understand.

If you'd like to watch my presentation, the user group was live broadcast as a Google Hangout and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckNdEPbiaY4#t=16m50s">now available on YouTube</a> (my session starts at about 17 minutes in). Additionally, <a href="https://twitter.com/Meligy">my colleague Meligy</a> also painstakingly recorded the presentation with his phone camera,Â <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heMj0ePj57A">also available on YouTube</a>.

The resolution of the recorded presentation may not be sufficient to read the detail on the slides or the PowerShell commands being executed during the demo. If you like to follow along at home,<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jstangroome/powershell-v4-desired-state-configuration-26513982"> the slides are available on SlideShare.net</a> and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jstangroome/6681972">demo script is available as a GitHub Gist</a>.
