A note to myself, and to others who may find it useful:

Use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132397.aspx" target="_blank">System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection&lt;T&gt;</a> (or a subclass) as the return type for properties exposing collections of related items on your presentation model classes if you intend to bind to the relationships with Windows Forms <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingsource.aspx" target="_blank">BindingSources</a>.

Collection&lt;T&gt; appears to be the lowest-level type in Framework 3.5 that provides both the non-generic IList implementation as required by the binding system and also provides strongly-typed programmatic access to the elements of the collection. It is used as the base for BindingList&lt;T&gt;, ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt; and many others and you can easily inherit from it yourself.

Using a return type of IList&lt;T&gt; or ICollection&lt;T&gt; instead, which may be preferred for being less concrete, is <strong>not </strong>sufficient as neither of these inherit from the non-generic IList and will fail to bind correctly (sometimes throwing exceptions) at run-time when the parent list of the bound relationship is empty.
