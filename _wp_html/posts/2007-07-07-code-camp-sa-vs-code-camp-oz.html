Not everyone in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide" target="_blank">Adelaide</a> can afford the time and travel costs to spend a weekend in Wagga so it is great that <a href="http://www.adnug.com/" target="_blank">ADNUG</a>, <a href="http://www.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank">UniSA</a>, and the <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/" target="_blank">ACS</a> have sponsored this event.</p>
<p>I was privileged to attend Code Camp Oz (CCOZ) this year&nbsp;and can't help but compare Code Camp SA (CCSA) to it. CCSA is held in a well-equipped lecture theatre at the local university and an excellent array of accomplished speakers have been gathered to present on relevant topics and upcoming technologies.</p>
<p>The sponsors have also arranged for morning and afternoon tea to be provided to attendees and a tasty BBQ lunch too. All this comes at no cost to the attendees. Unfortunately, CCSA missed a few issues that the CCOZ organisers have learned to expect.</p>
<p>Firstly, the University of South Australia's City West campus is not an area I'm familiar with, posted signage would have been very helpful for locating the venue.</p>
<p>Secondly, attendees like to bring notebook PCs to the presentations and most notebook batteries don't last the seven hours of the event. CCOZ supplied a box of power extension&nbsp;cables to allow attendees to switch their notebooks to AC.</p>
<p>Lastly, for an event dedicated to software developers, the wireless Internet connectivity was poorly organised. At a time when my work colleagues, my friends, myself, and <em>even my parents </em>all have high-speed wireless broadband connections at work <em>and</em> home, I expect the university to offer the same.</p>]]&gt;
