<div>I discovered an annoying&nbsp;limitation in the SQL Server Management Studio today. The GUI does not offer an option to add a Database Role as a member of another Database Role. In my case I wanted to add my "bigAppAdmins" role to the "bigAppUsers" role so all administrators are implicitly users also. Unfortunately I had to resort to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_sp_addp_4boy.asp">sp_addrolemember</a> stored procedure to achieve this. If I didn't already know that roles could be members of other roles I might have been convinced that SQL Server didn't support it.</div>
