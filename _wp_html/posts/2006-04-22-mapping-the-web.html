&lt;![CDATA[Discovered recently that Windows XP has really good support for WebDAV. This command will map an unused drive letter to a folder shared via HTTP:<br /><br />
<div><span style="font-style:italic;">net use * http://webdavserver/webdavfolder</span><br /></div><br />It's that easy. Hosting a WebDAV folder is also really easy on any machine with IIS. Just add a virtual directory, point it to your chosen local path and make sure it is browsable.<br />]]&gt;
