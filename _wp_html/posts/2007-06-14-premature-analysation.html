&lt;![CDATA[<p>I was thinking&nbsp;today as I was resolving a few <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Code Analysis</a> violations that perhaps I should stop. I will assume you are familiar with the quote "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=premature+optimization+is+the+root+of+all+evil" target="_blank">Premature optimisation is the root of all evil</a>" and if you're not, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._A._R._Hoare" target="_blank">you</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth" target="_blank">should</a> <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/v7i24_fallacy.html" target="_blank">be</a>.</p>
<p>I've often had the feeling that something wasn't quite right when I adjusted my code to satisfy the various&nbsp;CA <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182260(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">performance warnings</a>. Today I&nbsp;have investigated that feeling further:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fotomaker/441778648/" target="_blank"><img title="Photo by 'The Moment'" style="border-right:0;border-top:0;margin-bottom:1em;border-left:0;margin-right:2em;border-bottom:0;" height="240" alt="Winner of Zurich Marathon 2007" src="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/PrematureAnalysation_1336E/marathonportrait_1.jpg" width="154" align="left" border="0"></a> CA1809</strong>: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182263(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Avoid excessive locals</a> - Triggers when you have more than 64 local variables in a method because the processor registers can no longer hold them all and some will be moved to and from the stack. If you have this many variables in a single method you have other problems to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>CA1811</strong>: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182264(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Avoid uncalled private code</a> - Triggers when a private method exists that isn't called directly. This is great for finding and removing dead code but this is more about readability and not runtime performance.</p>
<p><strong>CA1812</strong>: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182265(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Avoid uninstantiated internal classes</a> - Very similar to CA1811 but at the class level. Once again, good for removing dead code but not really performance related.</p>
<p><strong>CA1807</strong>: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182266(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Avoid unnecessary string creation</a> - This is for people who still insist of using ToUpper or ToLower on strings before performing comparisons.&nbsp;Embrace the Unicode world&nbsp;and&nbsp;pass the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.stringcomparison.aspx" target="_blank">StringComparison</a> enumeration to String.Equals and String.Compare calls. This rule belongs in the Globalization set.</p>
<p><strong>CA1813</strong>: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182267(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Avoid unsealed attributes</a> - This might be the first real performance rule so far but it does apply specifically to reflection on custom attributes. If your&nbsp;application makes heavy use of attributes, you may want to pay attention here. I think though that your&nbsp;personal philosophy on preferring extendable classes versus sealed classes may have more weight here.</p>
<p><strong>CA1801</strong>: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182268(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">Review unused parameters</a> - Once again, this is an excellent rule for locating dead code that may be misleading or unnecessarily complicated to maintain. I am beginning to wonder if the Microsoft.Performance CA category is a misnomer.</p>
<p>This covers the first third of the 18&nbsp;rules on the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182260(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">performance warnings list</a>. So far only one could&nbsp;potentially undermine the performance of your application given the right conditions and I'd run an&nbsp;actual test to time this before I started making big changes.</p>
<p>However, the rules shouldn't be ignored, perhaps they should just be considered from a point of view other than performance. Hopefully investigating the rest of the list, which I plan to do in future posts, will reveal valid rules for improving performance. I'm expecting at least&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182272(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">CA1818</a> to come though for me there.</p>]]&gt;
