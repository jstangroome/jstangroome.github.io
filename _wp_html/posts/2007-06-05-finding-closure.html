<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> recently <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheDuhFilesTheFileIsTooLargeForTheDestinationFileSystem.aspx">posted about troubles with external hard drives</a> and large files. However, while file systems and compatibility between multiple OSes is quite a problem on it's own (and one I'll still need to <a href="http://www.lacie.com/au/products/product.htm?pid=10844">solve for myself</a> soon), I've been wrestling with a different large file issue.</p> <p>Several months ago I purchased (separately) a Samsung 40GB 2.5" PATA hard drive and a USB external hard drive enclosure to suit for quite a low price from eBay. Most of my data trafficking between home and work consisted of Office documents, source code, and other assorted small files. All was well.</p> <p>Since then, I have needed to transfer Virtual PC images, MSDN DVD images, and server backups and I have had&nbsp;no success. Without any error messages during the copy process I was finding that files over ~400MB copied to the external drive were corrupt. They had the same length as the original but a command line <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/fc.mspx">FC /B</a> or an <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290">FCIV</a> revealed that random bytes were different.</p> <p>Extensive Googling suggested motherboard USB power issues, cable quality problems, hard drive faults, and write-caching settings as potential causes. I methodically checked each possibility by using different machines, PCI USB controllers, new cables, a different 2.5" hard drive, and playing around in Device Manager. Nothing helped.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, my local computer store had a special on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=262">Western Digital Passport Portable Drives</a>. The Western Digital brand has always been good to me and I figured I could try one and have someone to complain to if it didn't work. I bought one and since then I've been moving all sorts of large files around (including 16GB Windows backups) without any problems.</p> <p>That's just one more time for me, learning the hard way to stop buying cheap components and instead to just fork out for the quality brands up front. It's <a href="http://secretgeek.net/onmetaphors.asp">like washing a spoon under a running tap</a>: occasionally you forget what happened last time and you&nbsp;get wet. So if you're getting corrupt files on an hard drive in an external enclosure, just cough up the cash and buy something better.</p>
