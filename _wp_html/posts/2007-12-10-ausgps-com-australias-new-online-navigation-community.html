Back in July, after watching my good friend Lewis enjoy the benefits of in-car satellite navigation for a some time, I decided to buy a <a href="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,6119fac2-2e5d-4764-b99c-1253360c66c7.aspx" target="_blank">TomTom One XL</a> for myself.

Since then, Lewis and I have had our fair share of both good and bad experiences with our chosen GPS devices and their respective feature support in Australia. While the devices sold locally are much the same, if not identical, to those sold worldwide, the quality of the maps and the availability of real-time data suffers in our sparsely populated nation.

In order to bring together the GPS users of Australia to share our experiences, our combined knowledge, and a form a central voice to the organisations responsible for improving our overall sat-nav situation, Lewis has started a new website just for us.

<a href="http://ausgps.com/" target="_blank">AusGPS.com</a> is live now and currently consists of a forum and a review of the popular current-model TomTom ONE v3. As the community grows the website will offer regular GPS-relevant news updates, more reviews on other devices and services available to Australians, and even a central download location for popular GPS accessories.

If you currently own a navigation device, or are thinking of purchasing one, check out <a href="http://ausgps.com/" target="_blank">Lewis' new site</a>, register on the forum and say hello.
