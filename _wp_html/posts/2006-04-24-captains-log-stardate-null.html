&lt;![CDATA[<div>Today I discovered a need for a data-bound DateTimePicker to support the display and input of NULL values. I remembered reading a blog a short while ago about someone else who had already developed a solution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Google helpfully pointed me to <a href="http://www.omnitalented.com/Blog/default.aspx">Alexander Shirshov's</a> original <a href="http://www.omnitalented.com/Blog/PermaLink,guid,9ee757fe-a3e8-46f7-ad04-ef7070934dc8.aspx">solution </a>that I had read before. However I also spotted <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/NullableDateTimePicker.asp">Claudio Grazioli's solution</a> on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">Code Project</a> which apparently correct some bugs in Alexander's implementation. I downloaded the source, gave it a try and it works very neatly. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If anyone would like the source for the NullableDateTimePicker in VB.NET instead of C# just leave a comment.</div>]]&gt;
