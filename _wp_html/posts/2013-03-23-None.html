I recently received a book from ex-Readifarian and fellow TFS-guy, Grant Holliday. The book is Professional Team Foundation Server and is co-authored by Ed Blankenship, Martin Woodward, Brian Keller, and Grant himself.

Having spent much or my recent career deploying, customising, and introducing teams to Microsoft's Team Foundation Server from the 2005 Beta versions to the current Update 1 of TFS 2012 I didn't expect to learn much from this book.

However I've been astounded at just how comprehensive the coverage is of almost every aspect of Team Foundation Server and its supporting products. Reading the introduction for each section of the book I found myself first thinking of all the various exceptions and considerations that I would deal within a consulting scenario, and then I found myself reading further into the chapter where each of these items were discussed in good detail.
