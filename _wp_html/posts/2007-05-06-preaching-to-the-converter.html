&lt;![CDATA[<p>During the past week I have managed to transfer my posts from <a href="http://jasonstangroome.spaces.live.com/">my Live Space</a> to this new Das Blog site. It was pleasantly trouble free, due mostly to the hard work having been already done by the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BlogML/Project/ProjectPeople.aspx">BlogML team</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest headache was the limitation of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259702.aspx">Live Space MetaWeblog API</a> implementation. The API will only allow you to retrieve the&nbsp;most recent&nbsp;20 posts or, if you know the postId, one post at a time. Unfortunately there is no supported method for retrieving the postIds beyond the&nbsp;most recent&nbsp;20.</p>
<p>Luckily, upon inspection of the nature of the postIds on my Live Space, and inspection of the <a href="http://thespacecraft.spaces.live.com/">Live Space Team's blog</a> for confirmation, I discovered a predictable pattern to the postId. It consists of a unique hex string for the space, and an exclamation mark followed by a decimal number that increments with each new post.</p>
<p>With this information I was able to write a Live Space to BlogML converter that, while not exhibiting amazing performance, is able to retrieve all posts on a Live Space much easier than doing it manually or by screen-scraping.</p>
<p>My currently one-way Live Space converter is available in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BlogML/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx">ChangeSet</a> 21935 and later of the BlogML project on CodePlex. Hopefully the project coordinators will build a new release soon and it will then be available as part of the main package.</p>
<p>To use the converter, start by <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259698.aspx">enabling email publishing</a> on your Live Space. Then create a new Visual Studio project and reference the LiveSpace.BlogML assembly. Construct an instance of the&nbsp;LiveSpaceBlogMLWriter passing the name of your Live Space and your email publishing secret word. Optionally set the PostCount property to a number ideally no greater than the number of posts on your site. Finally, call the Write method passing&nbsp;a preconfigured XmlWriter as the destination.</p>
<p>Please submit any issues you have with the converter to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BlogML/Thread/List.aspx">BlogML&nbsp;Discussion</a> pages&nbsp;and I'll endeavour to solve them. For those without the&nbsp;resources or inclination to write a program as mentioned above, let me know and I'll find some time to create a user interface for it.</p>
