<p>Last time I looked into the options for migrating physical machines to Microsoft Virtual PC/Server I only found the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/virtualserver/downloads/vsmt.mspx">Virtual Server Migration Toolkit</a>. I downloaded all the appropriate components and began following the installation instructions. I quickly found myself overwhelmed by a solution too complex for moving one or two desktops to virtual machines.</p> <p>With a notebook refresh on the horizon I decided I should look into my options again, hoping to virtualize my old system as a form of runnable backup. I discovered an excellent collection of blog posts from over a year ago <a href="http://blogs.virtualserver.tv/blogs/virtualmachine/default.aspx">conveniently listed&nbsp;here</a>. The articles are spread out but do an excellent job to explain the common problems and how to&nbsp;solve them. I am summarising the process here mainly for my convenience but I'm sure it will be&nbsp;useful to others.</p> <ul> <li>Install the Standard/Generic IDE Controller driver on the physical machine.  <li>Copy an image of the physical drive into a VHD*. <li>Use Safe Mode/Recovery Console to disable drivers that halt the boot. <li>Replace System32\HAL.DLL with HALACPI.DLL from the Windows CD. <li>Install VM Additions,&nbsp;uninstall unnecessary drivers.</li></ul> <p>For full details on achieving these steps, refer back to the original articles and you should end with a&nbsp;functional Virtual PC of your physical machine. Even better, your physical machine is untouched and still usable.</p> <p>* The original articles suggest using Virtual PC's linked physical disk feature to mount the actual hard drive and then convert it to a VHD. Unfortunately, Virtual PC 2007 does not include this feature anymore, however I found this <a href="http://www.sysdevsoftware.com/soft/makevm.php">MakeVM</a> software which sounds promising.</p> <p>Of course, there is also the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> range of virtualization products which apparently have much better <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/">P2V</a> solutions.</p>
