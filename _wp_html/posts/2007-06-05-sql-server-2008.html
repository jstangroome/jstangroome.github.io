<p>It's hard to keep up. Microsoft have <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=6899949">recently released the June CTP for SQL Server 2008</a>. You may need to sign in with your Windows Live ID to follow that link and you definitely need to apply for the SQL CTP program if you want to download it. I guess it makes sense for us to start seeing SQL 2008 now as it probably&nbsp;coincides with the Visual Studio 2008 RTM later this year.</p>
