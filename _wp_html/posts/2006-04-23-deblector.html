<div>Lutz Roeder... you're the bomb. I've been using .NET Reflector for quite some time now and I love every bit of it. If you aren't using it yet, <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">go get it</a>. However, there is one thing I've always wanted to do with Reflector, use it to debug code. As I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/archive/2006/04/22/felice_pollano.aspx">recently discovered</a> on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/default.aspx">Mike Stall's excellent debugging blog</a> someone is working on integrating debugging into Reflector. That someone is <a href="http://www.felicepollano.com/">Felice Pollano</a> and hopefully <a href="http://www.felicepollano.com/PermaLink,guid,e547bca8-cc99-4d75-b320-c3e58b723fae.aspx">Deblector</a> will soon become one of my primary development tools too.</div>
