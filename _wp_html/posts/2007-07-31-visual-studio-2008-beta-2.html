<p>I installed VS2008 Beta 2 on a spare machine on the weekend and I am beginning to use it for development. Today I waded through the Tools, Options dialog setting up the IDE with a few sensible defaults. Several default values have changed since VS2005 and for the better. Unfortunately two settings are still outdated.</p> <p>VB still defaults Option Strict to Off whilst Option Explicit and the new Option Infer are On. They should all be on by default.</p> <p>Also, when the new range of Microsoft fonts were released for Vista and Office, an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">update for VS2005</a> was released to use the new Consolas type in the IDE. VS2008 still defaults to the non-ClearType Courier New though.</p> <p>Aside from those two issues so far, I'm loving the new Visual Studio.</p>
