&lt;![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maniya/881295232/" target="_blank"><img title="Photo by Mani Babbar" style="border-right:0;border-top:0;margin-bottom:2em;border-left:0;margin-right:2em;border-bottom:0;" alt="Remote location" src="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CodeCampSADarrenNeimke_129FC/remote_1.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a> On Sunday July 8th, <a href="http://markitup.com/" target="_blank">Darren</a> of Readify, and most importantly of Adelaide, closed the inaugural Code Camp SA with a <a href="http://markitup.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=3bbbae88-fa2f-452d-b15b-1710d14a9034" target="_blank">quality presentation</a>. After a couple of false starts it was eventually revealed that Darren would be discussing remote development.</p>
<p>Remote development doesn't necessarily&nbsp;mean sitting&nbsp;atop the Alps with a laptop and some pretty amazing Wi-Fi Internet. It can be a simple as working apart from your fellow development team members such that you can't simply step over to the neighbouring office and discuss your task face to face.</p>
<p>While I generally share an&nbsp;office with the other developers where I work, we do have two&nbsp;offices about&nbsp;thirty minutes apart and I have been working from home on an increasingly regular basis. With this trend likely to continue, the ability to effectively communicate with the team when separated is a growing concern.</p>
<p>In the office I can ask a coworker to look over my shoulder to give a second opinion on some code or we can step over to the whiteboard and represent the problem visually and discuss a solution. In my study at home I have email, I have instant messaging, and I have my mobile phone. These are all excellent systems for communicating verbally or textually but that's where it ends.</p>
<p>I've tried the whiteboard-style collaboration software but drawing class diagrams with a mouse or notebook touchpad just isn't helpful. The other benefit you lose on your own is other team members overhearing your coding pains and butting in with a solution that you probably would have struggled with for much longer before finally asking for help.</p>
<p>Darren demonstrated that having a Tablet PC (or <a href="http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/" target="_blank">a similar device</a>) can be great for shared whiteboard sessions and new tools like <a href="http://www.connect.microsoft.com/content/content.aspx?ContentID=4791&amp;SiteID=94" target="_blank">SharedView</a> can help with peer code review or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">Pair Programming</a>. I'm not sure what to do about "overhearing" your coworkers apart from a persistent VOIP conference call running in the background and that could be embarrassing when you forget it's on.</p>
<p>Overall, Darren's presentation gave me some good&nbsp;solutions for&nbsp;working remotely and gave me some other ideas to ponder on. And, Darren, if you are reading this, do you have any recommendations for coffee shops with good affordable Wi-Fi Internet in Adelaide?</p>]]&gt;
