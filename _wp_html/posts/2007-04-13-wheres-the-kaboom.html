&lt;![CDATA[<p>My new home office machine&nbsp;has arrived and I am setting myself up for the most pain possible with my chosen configuration.&nbsp;Firstly I am installing Visual Studio 2005 on Vista Business Edition. Microsoft has only just released a patch for Visual Studio&nbsp;on Vista and it <a title="Visual Studio 2005 on Windows Vista Issue List" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa964140.aspx">isn't perfect</a>. Add to that running as a restricted user in Vista which introduces <a title="Visual Studio 2005 on Windows Vista Issue List - Non Admin" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa972193.aspx">more problems</a>. Finally I've chosen the 64-bit edition of Vista which complicates <a title="Code coverage binaries are not marked as 32-bit only causing them to crash on wow64" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa964140.aspx#question43">working with Visual Studio</a> and&nbsp;<a title="List of limitations in 64-Bit Windows" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282423">software in general</a>. </p>
<p>Reading the many articles and forum posts about problems with Vista and 64-bit will discourage most people from trying but so far I've found the experience to be quite pleasant. The first road-block is the need for new Vista 64-bit signed&nbsp;hardware drivers but Windows detected everything but the onboard sound and I was able to very easily find drivers on the HP web site for that. Two&nbsp;vital utilities, <a href="http://www.daemon-tools.cc/">Daemon Tools</a> and <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/">UltraMon</a>, are already available with Vista x64 versions.</p>
<p>Vista has streamlined .zip file handling so I don't need any archiving software and the usual problems with new OS burning software are gone because Vista writes to&nbsp;CD and DVD out of the box. The small problem of burning disc images is solved by the free <a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/">ISO Recorder</a>, updated for Vista x64. I&nbsp;don't need <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2004/07/24/193721.aspx">MakeMeAdmin</a> anymore because Vista's UAC temporary privilege elevation features have solved the problem. And, of course, Microsoft Office works beautifully.</p>
<p>I could rant for hours about the wonders of this new system but there were&nbsp;some issues. I managed to crash Visual Studio while setting the options for the first time but this is an easily avoidable&nbsp;<a title="Opening the Add-in/Macros Security option in the Tools dialog will hang Visual Studio" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa964140.aspx#question20">documented issue</a> (thanks <a href="http://www.nervoustych.com/">Jim</a>). I upgraded SQL Server 2005 to SP2 via Vista's built in AutoUpdate tool so I needed to run the <a title="Administrator Rights Not Inherited from Windows" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/B/5/2B5E5D37-9B17-423D-BC8F-B11ECD4195B4/ReadmeSQL2005SP2.htm#_windows_vista">User Provisioning Tool</a> manually afterward to be able to connect. Also, a minor annoyance,&nbsp;Windows x64 has a separate Program Files folder for 32-bit and 64-bit applications and some installers were defaulting to the wrong folder.</p>
<p>I'm keeping a list of issues I encounter with Windows in general and developing with Visual Studio and SQL Server. I'll write about my experiences further on this blog as time passes and as&nbsp;I start pushing the boundaries of compatibility. At this point I have no regrets moving to Vista and 64-bit. I sure don't want to go back to either 32-bit or Windows XP and I'd recommend anyone with&nbsp;similar needs to my own to do the same.</p>]]&gt;
