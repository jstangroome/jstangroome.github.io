&lt;![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phillip/345829246/" target="_blank"><img title="Photo by Phillip Ingham" style="border-right:0;border-top:0;margin-bottom:2em;border-left:0;margin-right:2em;border-bottom:0;" alt="Tax Calculator" src="http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/DeathTaxesandSoftware_13268/taxcalc_1.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a> The new 2007/2008 financial year has begun and as promised the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/" target="_blank">Australian Taxation Office</a> released the latest version of their <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/etax/" target="_blank">e-tax software</a> on July 1st. As I have for the past several years, I downloaded and installed the software and have started entering my income and deductions for the last 12 months.</p>
<p>When the official paperwork arrives, I'll confirm all my figures and submit my tax return electronically and receive my rebate usually within a week, deposited directly to my bank account. Considering the complexity of the income tax system, the software is excellent for non-accountant-types to complete their own tax return.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, e-tax 2007 is still stuck in the obsolete Windows administrator user world. Installation defaults to "c:\etax2007\". It has been over twelve years since Windows 95 was released and the standard was set for software to install into Program Files.</p>
<p>A single e-tax installation on a PC allows multiple people to fill in and submit their tax return, saving their work in progress locally until it is ready&nbsp;to send. However, the software assumes the user is an administrator and writes the *.tax progress file to the installation folder instead of Documents &amp; Settings.</p>
<p>At several stages throughout the questionnaire, summaries and important details are presented to the user with a recommendation to print the information. However, the software always uses the default printer with the default settings, offering no dialogs, and only picking up changes to the default&nbsp;printer after restarting the software.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons why e-tax is so great is because the questions are presented in easy to understand language. Whenever more detail is required there&nbsp;are always hyperlinked keywords or a help button leading to a more extension definition with examples. Sadly, it's all useless under Vista because they've stayed with the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917607" target="_blank">deprecated WinHelp format</a> for the documentation.</p>
<p>Lastly, for users of Apple computers (and presumably other OSes), <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.asp?doc=/content/73931.htm" target="_blank">the official solution</a> is to use virtualization. I wonder if the purchase price of VMWare or&nbsp;Parallels and a Windows licence can be claimed as a cost of preparing the tax return.</p>
<p>By all appearances e-tax is a full Win32 application, probably written in C++ at first glance, and is expected to continue in that&nbsp;style for the majority of users next financial year too. Perhaps by 2009, they will have moved to a web-based client, which will open the system to non-Windows users but probably introduce other problems along the way.</p>]]&gt;
