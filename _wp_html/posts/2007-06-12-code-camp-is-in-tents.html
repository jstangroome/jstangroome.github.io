Unfortunately not everyone can find the time to drive twelve hours across the country for a weekend. </p>
<p>However, anyone living in South Australia will have an opportunity to attend the upcoming Code Camp SA, a free event sponsored by the <a href="http://www.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank">University of South Australia</a>, the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/" target="_blank">Adelaide .NET Users Group</a>, and the <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/" target="_blank">Australian Computer Society</a>.</p>
<p>It will be held at the UniSA City <strike>East</strike> West campus for both days of the July 7th and 8th weekend. Specific details and registration can be found on the ACS web site for <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/index.cfm?action=event&amp;temID=eventdetails&amp;eveID=2093" target="_blank">Saturday</a> and <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/index.cfm?action=event&amp;temID=eventdetails&amp;eveID=2094" target="_blank">Sunday</a>. When available, the scheduled program will be published on the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/news.htm" target="_blank">ADNUG news page</a>.</p>
<p>If the content and quality of Code Camp Oz is anything to go by, this is an event that shouldn't be missed. See you there.</p>]]&gt;
