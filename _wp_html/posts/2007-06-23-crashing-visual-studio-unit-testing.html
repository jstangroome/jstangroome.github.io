<p>Yesterday I managed to crash vstesthost.exe, the program that runs Visual Studio Unit Tests when you press Ctrl+Shift+X. A few tests in my suite would run and pass, then BAM, fatal error. I ran the tests again, this time in debug mode and the tests broke into the debugger with a StackOverflowException, due to a poorly implemented interface in a mock object.</p> <p>According to some searching, some exceptions including <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.stackoverflowexception.aspx" target="_blank">StackOverflowException</a>, just cannot be caught in .NET 2.0 and I'm not sure it would be smart to try. Unfortunately when it happens in testing, the whole suite fails. In my case, I was able to pave over my mistake in the code and move on with my life.</p> <p>The vstesthost crashing problem also happens when an exception is through on a secondary thread though. Testing asynchronous UI or background processing code could also kill the process when any exceptions occur, and these might be expected exceptions for a particular tests.</p> <p>I haven't needed to use it yet, but there is a workaround to avoid the whole test suite falling over. It involves editing the vstesthost.exe.config file to enable the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228965.aspx" target="_blank">legacy unhandled exception policy</a> as&nbsp;used&nbsp;by the earlier CLR versions. You will need to be careful to synchronise your threads though to ensure any exceptions are assigned to the correct test in the results.</p>
