&lt;![CDATA[I haven&#039;t used much of the built in data binding in .NET yet, preferring to keep things under my own control. However, the current project is using it heavily and I really should get up to speed before it&#039;s too late. Here is a small tip that was easy to miss on some of the project&#039;s earlier code:<br /><br />
<div><span style="font-style:italic;">"Try using myBindingSource.ResetCurrentItem instead of myBindingSource.ResetBindings when you need to propagate small data changes throughout an application. It can be much more efficient when you are dealing with big lists."</span><br /></div>]]&gt;
