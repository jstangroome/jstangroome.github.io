In a sad attempt to get blogging again, I am going to start by responding to [this blatant prod](http://www.nervoustych.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,826827b3-3f22-47cf-a034-5c127578977c.aspx). I agree with some of [Jim](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/7/b62/608)'s answers but to keep it interesting I've selected a disjoint set and [knocked it up a notch](http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Elzar). I am: Pragmatic about [dogmatism](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655/). Practicing [consumerism](http://www.codeassassin.com/dvds.txt). Prone to [defeatism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeatism). Parodying [athleticism](http://www.polar.fi/au-en/products/running_multisport/RS200). Proof of [determinism](http://xkcd.com/505/). To keep it going, the same rule applies: if you've read this then follow suit blogging your own answers, even if you are busy writing your own blog engine.
