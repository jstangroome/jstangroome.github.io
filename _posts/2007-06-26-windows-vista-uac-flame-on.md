If you are running [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/default.mspx) and are bothered by "too many"Â [UAC](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/aa905108.aspx) dialogs on a regular basis to the point that you want to turn UAC off, the problem is that you are [futzing](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/futz) with your PC instead of doing real work.
