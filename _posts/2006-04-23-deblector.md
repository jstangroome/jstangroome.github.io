Lutz Roeder... you're the bomb. I've been using .NET Reflector for quite some time now and I love every bit of it. If you aren't using it yet, [go get it](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/). However, there is one thing I've always wanted to do with Reflector, use it to debug code. As I [recently discovered](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/archive/2006/04/22/felice_pollano.aspx) on [Mike Stall's excellent debugging blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/default.aspx) someone is working on integrating debugging into Reflector. That someone is [Felice Pollano](http://www.felicepollano.com/) and hopefully [Deblector](http://www.felicepollano.com/PermaLink,guid,e547bca8-cc99-4d75-b320-c3e58b723fae.aspx) will soon become one of my primary development tools too.
