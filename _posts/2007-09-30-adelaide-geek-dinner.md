I am organising a dinner get-together for local developers to meet, socialise, and learn from each other. I am still finalising details of the time and venue (which will depend on the numbers of guests) but I am currently thinking it will be an evening in the middle of November at a restaurant in the Adelaide CBD.

Also, to avoid being overwhelmed by numbers and to ensure the concept will work here before scaling up, I am going to start by only inviting .NET developers who also publish a blog.Â I already know a few such people in South Australia and have found a few more on Google and will ensure they receive an invitation but I'm sure I've missed some.

So, if you are, or know someone who is, a .NET developer and a blogger and will be in Adelaide in November, send me an email or post a comment here, and I will make sure you receive an invitation when the details have been settled.

If you are a .NET developer but not a blogger and would really like to attend, just grab a free [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/start) or [Live Spaces](http://home.services.spaces.live.com/) account and post one article about your .NET experiences then let me know.

If the evening is a success then we can plan to have these dinners on a regular basis and open the guest list to a larger range of people. Looking forward to meeting you...
