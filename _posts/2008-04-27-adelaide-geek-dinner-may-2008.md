After the success of the [local geek dinner in early February](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,3d03ace8-1a30-4437-9152-275d08d7e7d3.aspx), I intended to organise another one in late March but I became a little overwhelmed at home and work and completely forgot to organise it. My apologies to those who had been looking forward to it.

However, I am now officially organising another dinner for Saturday May 17th. Instead of the usual location (where customer satisfaction has taken a turn for me) I will be relocating the dinner to another restaurant. I will strive to choose a replacement that is still located centrally, has good parking and public transport access, and affordable, enjoyable food with the option to split the bill.

At this point I'm considering [Caffe Amore](http://www.cafeamore.com.au/) on the corner of Pulteney and Pirie Streets in the CBD, about 400m from the previous venue. I enjoyed dinner there with friends a few weeks ago and was quite pleased with their food and service. Assuming I can book a table there for all the guests and no one suggests a better alternative, this will probably be the new venue.

I will be sending an email invitation to all the previous dinner guests but if you don't receive yours before May or haven't attended before and would like to join us, please don't hesitate to contact me as soon as possible so I can give the restaurant an accurate number of guests to expect.

I hope to see a few people who made it to [Code Camp Oz](http://www.codecampoz.com/) this year. I was unfortunately double-booked and unable to attend and would like to hear all about it.
