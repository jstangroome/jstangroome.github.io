[![Ecstatic Mascot](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/EcstaticAboutNStatic_7035/ecstatic_1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattyfioner/274312463/)[Wesner Moise](http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/) is getting ever closer to public release of his very promising [NStatic](http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/nstatic/index.html) static analysis tool for .NET. In general static analysis tools are very expensive but as part of [Wes' plans](http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2007/06/nstatic-plans.html), a lower price to achieve market penetration is most likely. In fact, until he finds a suitable publisher he expects to selling independently for a few months, during which time we might be lucky to pick it up for a "bargain" price.

So far I think NStatic only supports C# 2.0 but there are plans to add support for C# 3.0 features and maybe VB.NET too if the demand is there. I, for one, sure hope that VB support becomes a reality, I think our current suite of software could really benefit from some in depth analysis.

Keep a close eye on Wesner's blog for the latest information.
