While others were invited but were unfortunately unable to attend, a very friendly and interesting eight people ultimately arrived. In no particular order:

  * [Keith Zerna](http://www.sanrez.com/)
  * [James Chapman-Smith](http://enigmativity.com/blog/)
  * [David Gardiner](http://davidgardiner.blogspot.com/)
  * [Paul Stovell](http://www.paulstovell.net/blog/)
  * [Darren Neimke](http://showusyourcode.spaces.live.com/)
  * [Steve Burger](http://www.lgs.sa.gov.au/)
  * [Jim Burger](http://www.nervoustych.com/blog/)
  * and myself.

The evening started at 6:30pm (for most of us ;) and eventually came to a close at around 10:30pm after everyone was quite full from a delicious dinner and meaty conversation. I've uploaded a couple of photos to my Flickr account [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jstangroome/sets/72157603219193801/).

I was originally uncertain about trying to organise such an event especially as I had only briefly met some of the guys before and some not at all. I am very glad I did though because I learned a lot, had some good laughs, and made some new friends too.

The response was so good that I plan to arrange another dinner, with a few more people who couldn't make it this time (eg Candy ;). An evening in January 2008 is my goal but this time I'll invite suggestions for venue, date, and anything else that you think might be a good idea.

Watch this blog for more information on the next dinner as it becomes available and if you'd like to be invited, just send me an email or leave a comment here on the blog.
