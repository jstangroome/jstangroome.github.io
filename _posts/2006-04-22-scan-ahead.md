<![CDATA[In my current project we expect to need to integrate scanning documents into our database. I thought I should do a quick preliminary search on how to control a scanner from a .NET WinForms application. Here are a few links other may find useful:  
  
  * [How to use Windows Image Acquisition from .NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/someassemblyrequired/lookatme/default.aspx)
  * [Scanners supported by Windows Image Acquisition](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q293356)
  * [How to use TWAIN from .NET](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/twaindotnet.asp)
