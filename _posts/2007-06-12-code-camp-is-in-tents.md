[![A tent on the beach](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/RegisterForCodeCampSA_13FAC/tentonbeach_1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bobydimitrov/492568899/) I was privileged to attend [Code Camp Oz](http://www.codecampoz.com/) 2007 in [Wagga Wagga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga) this year and I highly recommend it to anyone working with .NET. Unfortunately not everyone can find the time to drive twelve hours across the country for a weekend.

However, anyone living in South Australia will have an opportunity to attend the upcoming Code Camp SA, a free event sponsored by the [University of South Australia](http://www.unisa.edu.au/), the [Adelaide .NET Users Group](http://www.adnug.com/), and the [Australian Computer Society](http://www.acs.org.au/).

It will be held at the UniSA City ~~East~~ West campus for both days of the July 7th and 8th weekend. Specific details and registration can be found on the ACS web site for [Saturday](http://www.acs.org.au/index.cfm?action=event&temID=eventdetails&eveID=2093) and [Sunday](http://www.acs.org.au/index.cfm?action=event&temID=eventdetails&eveID=2094). When available, the scheduled program will be published on the [ADNUG news page](http://www.adnug.com/news.htm).

If the content and quality of Code Camp Oz is anything to go by, this is an event that shouldn't be missed. See you there.
