Today I discovered a need for a data-bound DateTimePicker to support the display and input of NULL values. I remembered reading a blog a short while ago about someone else who had already developed a solution.

 

Google helpfully pointed me to [Alexander Shirshov's](http://www.omnitalented.com/Blog/default.aspx) original [solution ](http://www.omnitalented.com/Blog/PermaLink,guid,9ee757fe-a3e8-46f7-ad04-ef7070934dc8.aspx)that I had read before. However I also spotted [Claudio Grazioli's solution](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/NullableDateTimePicker.asp) on [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/) which apparently correct some bugs in Alexander's implementation. I downloaded the source, gave it a try and it works very neatly.

 

If anyone would like the source for the NullableDateTimePicker in VB.NET instead of C# just leave a comment.
