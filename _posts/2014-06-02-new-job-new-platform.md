After about five and a half years I have resigned from my job with [Readify](http://readify.net/). I have had a great time working for Readify as a software developer, a consultant, an ALM specialist, and an infrastructure coder. Had a new opportunity not presented itself I could have easily continued working for Readify for years to come. The decision to leave was definitely not easy. Over the last 16 years working as an IT professional I've had the opportunity to gain experience with almost all aspects of software development, system administration, networking, and security but all of it on the Microsoft platform. I did do some work with PERL and PHP on Apache and MySQL back in the late 90s (like everyone did I'm sure) but I haven't spent any quality time with Linux or Mac OS X since. Starting on June 10th this year (2014) I will begin a new job with [Squixa](http://www.squixa.com/). Squixa provide a set of services for improving the end-user performance of existing web sites and exposing analytics to the web site's owners. Squixa's implementation currently involves very few Microsoft technologies, if any. Subsequently my future includes the exciting experience of learning a new set of operating systems, development languages, web servers, database systems, build tools, and so on. I still have a passion for PowerShell and I feel that the direction Microsoft is heading with Azure, Visual Studio Online, and Project K is exciting and promises to become a much better platform than it is today so I will continue to stay informed of new developments. However, aside from small hobby projects, most of my time, effort, and daily challenges will come from the *nix world and future blog posts will likely reflect this.
