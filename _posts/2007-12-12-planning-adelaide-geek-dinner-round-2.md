My first attempt to organise a [dinner for developers](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,49228f2f-6a59-43f8-a82c-dd36b4e1b3bf.aspx) in Adelaide exceeded my expectations. Everyone seemed to have a good time and expressed an interest to do it again... we tentatively agreed on January.

This time, I'd like to re-invite [some](http://blog.adamant.com.au/) [of](http://blog.spencen.com/) [the](http://paulturner.is-a-geek.com/) [guests](http://msmvps.com/blogs/robfarley/) who were unable to attend in November, and try to schedule an available time for everyone. I'd also like to get feedback on the choice of venue.

Last time I chose Cafe Buongiorno because it is located centrally in the CBD, offers separate accounts to avoid [table-banking](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=table+banking), and has convenient parking and public transport. Most people like pizza and pasta too. I don't want to bore people with the same restaurant every time so I'd like to hear suggestions for alternatives, but if you all like the cafe it can stay.

Also, I chose a Saturday evening last time so people didn't have to rush from work to get to the dinner but if Sunday or a weekday would be better, or perhaps a lunch-time event interests you, pass on your comments.

Finally, if you know any other developers who may be interested in attending, put them in touch with me and I'll ensure they get invited.
