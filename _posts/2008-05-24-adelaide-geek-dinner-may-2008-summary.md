[![Photo of the guests](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2398/2504508059_ff09f0702f_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jstangroome/2504508059/) The May Geek Dinner was long overdue but well worth the wait. I invited a record high number of people, fifteen, but due to a variety of circumstances, a record low number of people made it to the dinner: five, including myself.

I was joined by the always entertaining regulars: [Paul Stovell](http://www.paulstovell.com/), [Keith Zerna](http://sanrez.com/), and [Jim Burger](http://www.nervoustych.com/). We were also pleased to be joined by [Nigel Spencer](http://blog.spencen.com/) for the first time since I started organising the dinners last year.

Aside from the usual .NET subjects, many other topics were discussed on the night, here are some links in no particular order:

  * Clay Shirky on Social Surplus: [video](http://blip.tv/file/855937), [transcript](http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html)
  * Perfection Fresh's naturally grown [Enchanted Apple](http://www.perfection.com.au/01_cms/details.asp?ID=791)
  * NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter [metric mix-up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#The_metric_mixup)
  * Self-reconfigurable robots ([article preview](http://technology.newscientist.com/channel/tech/mg19826531.200-shapeshifting-robots-take-form.html))
  * Are we approaching the [Great Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Filter)?

I am writing this summary a week since the night of the dinner and I've managed to forget some of the night's events. Perhaps the other attendees could leave some comments with links to the interesting topics I've missed.

Watch this blog for details of the August 2008 Dinner which I'll likely post after [Code Camp SA](http://pgriffith.wordpress.com/2008/05/18/codecampsa/).
