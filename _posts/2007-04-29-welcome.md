Welcome to my new blog domain.

I recently decided that I would commit to a more regular blogging schedule. I've kept to my plan for three weeks so far and decided I wanted some more control over my blog than Live Spaces would allow. This site is the result.

There may be lull in the posts while I investigate the [Live Spaces MetaWeblog API](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259702.aspx) to export my old posts at [Jason's Thoughts](http://jasonstangroome.spaces.live.com/) to [BlogML](http://www.codeplex.com/BlogML) then import them to this new site. Hopefully it won't be very long at all and will generate some material worth blogging in the process.

In the mean time, links to my scattering of other content is in the Navigation side bar and I highly recommend my favourite bloggers listed in the Blogroll sidebar.
