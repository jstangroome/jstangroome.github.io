[![Ferrari](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/99c96dc6d781_C410/redcar_1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/clspeace/398933088/) I've always maintained an interest in the current PC hardware scene. I like to keep abreast of the performance, prices, and problems with the various components available. I've built many PCs for myself, my friends, my employer, and even registered a business and sold a few to the public.

Understandably people often ask for my opinion when they are looking to buy a PC for themselves. I'm very very slowly coming to the realisation that I need to stop "helping" these people. Most of the time I have recommended components or systems that I have personally owned but even then their experience isn't necessarily the same as mine and then I feel responsible when it doesn't work out.

I have stopped operating my personal business and now I pay retail for all my hardware instead of going to wholesalers. I have also stopped building my own PCs and my last three purchases have been big name, off the shelf computers. It just isn't worth my time anymore to save a few bucks wherever I can.

From now on, my advice to myself, and to anyone else who asks, is to spend more. Looking for a new computer, LCD monitor, or video card? Spend more. Not everyone can afford it, it's not going to give you the best grunt for your money, but it sure has saved me a lot of time messing around. It's also a lot more affordable than buying the cheap option only to discover it sucks and you need to buy the expensive model too.
