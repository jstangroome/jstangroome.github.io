Several weeks ago [Richard Banks](http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/) ([@rbanks54](http://twitter.com/rbanks54)) coerced me to find time to present to the Australian Virtual Alt.NET User Group between moving house and deploying a new website to production for my current client. I agreed and with an absurdly short amount of preparation presented to a small group online using Microsoft Live Meeting and a shared PowerShell console window. You can [watch the presentation](http://ozalt.net/blog/virtual-alt-net-11-may-09-powershell-and-ngourd/) on the [Oz Alt.NET Community Blog](http://ozalt.net/blog/). The “slides” and example scripts can be [downloaded here](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/255217/OzVAN-PowerShell.zip).
