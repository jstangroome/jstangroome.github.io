In my [last post](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,8257b49e-fc4e-472f-9f5b-a7b2bc2ee0db.aspx) about the Adelaide Geek Dinner, I intended to schedule the coming dinner for January. Unfortunately, if I scheduled it for the last weekend in January, that would coincide with the Australia Day long weekend and I imagine several people already have plans.

Therefore, the next dinner will instead be Saturday 2nd February, but once again at Cafe Buongiorno, Rundle Street, starting at 6:30pm. I have sent invitations via email to all the people who attended last time and also to those who couldn't make it.

If you didn't receive an invitation and would like to attend, contact me and I'll arrange it. Please RSVP by Thursday 24th January so I can ensure enough seats will be reserved at the restaurant.

I look forward to discussing all the interesting things that have been happening since the November dinner.
