As [promised in May](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,ac5db07c-f73c-40a2-9077-474025f3f953.aspx), it is time for the August Geek Dinner, specifically the time will be 6:30pm on Saturday 16th August. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food and atmosphere of [Caffe Amore](http://www.cafeamore.com.au/) on the corner of Pulteney and Pirie Streets last time so we'll be going there again this time.

If you're already on the geek dinner mailing list from previous times expect an invitation shortly. If you've never been invited before or you think your invite may be lost in the mail, just contact me and I'll make sure you get included.

Please RSVP before Wednesday 13th August so I can finalise the booking with the restaurant. Hope to see you all there!
