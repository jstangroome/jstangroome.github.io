I was hit with trackback spam on my blog some time ago and decided the easiest way to stop it was to disable trackbacks on the site all together. The unfortunate downside to this is that I'm not automatically notified when someone blogs in response to one of my posts. I have to go looking.

Today I found a post by [Doron Yaacoby](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/dorony/) written in August (sorry I took so long) about the Live Space support I added to the [BlogML project](http://www.codeplex.com/BlogML/). As I [originally mentioned](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,5b322a3a-dd22-4900-9821-9b863afe3261.aspx) when I posted about this feature, I was too lazy to code a GUI for it. Thankfully, Doron has [written one for us](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/dorony/archive/2007/08/11/Converting-a-Windows-Live-Spaces-blog-to-BlogML.aspx), and in WPF too!

It has been a while since I actually used my Live Space BlogML code to convert my own blog but, in response to Doron's note about comment support, from memory the API exposed by the Live Spaces website for querying blog data does not expose comments. Maybe they've changed the API since. Maybe there's a clever way to screen-scrape it.

Thanks for contributing Doron, and thanks for your kind words about my code too.
