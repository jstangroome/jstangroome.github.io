I announced earlier that I was [planning a dinner get-together for developers in Adelaide](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,65dd9b9c-ed7e-42cd-964b-dd14054e273f.aspx). I have since finalised the time and venue and have established an initial guest list.

The dinner will be held on Saturday November 17th starting 6:30pm at Cafe Buongiorno in the city. The cafe is at 187 Rundle Street, near the corner of Pulteney Street and the entrance to U-Park (for convenient parking). They serve familiar Italian meals - pizza and pasta starting at around $15.

I have found and contacted several local developer-bloggers and asked them to attend, some have committed, some have tentatively accepted but the response has been positive. If you are, or know, a local developer-blogger who hasn't been personally invited, send me an email and I'll add you to the guest list and ensure I book a large enough table at the cafe.

I look forward to seeing you there.
