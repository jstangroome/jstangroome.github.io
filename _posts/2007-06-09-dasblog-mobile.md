Today I had the pleasure of visiting this web site with a Windows Mobile device. I was thoroughly pleased to discover that, without any configuration on my part, the blog rendered in Pocket Internet Explorer in a very clean, usable form.

I was even able to read the comments and submit my own. I must say though that the limited input capabilities of many PDAs really emphasise how annoying CAPTCHA can be.

Anti-spam mechanisms aside, the DasBlog developers have done an excellent job to provide yet another feature out-of-the-box that I was worried I would have to implement myself.

Thank [you](http://www.dasblog.info/DeveloperTeam.aspx).
