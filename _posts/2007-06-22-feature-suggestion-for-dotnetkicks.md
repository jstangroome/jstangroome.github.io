[![Donkey](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/FeatureSuggestionForDotNetKicks_A18E/donkey_1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/treehouse1977/526742180/)[Gavin Joyce](http://blog.incremental.ie/) announced a few months ago that the [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/) community website will be [going open source](http://weblogs.asp.net/gavinjoyce/archive/2007/03/20/dotnetkicks-to-be-open-source.aspx). Gavin has since created a [DotNetKicks project on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetkicks/) with some placeholders and has asked for people interested in contributing to join. One thing that isn't clear is whether the engine will be open source for others to build their own sites or if all the updates will get deployed back to DotNetKicks.com.

Regardless, I already have one idea in mind. In a moment of complete clumsiness, while trying to quickly submit a post to DotNetKicks before going to bed, I associated the wrong Title and Description with the wrong Url. Unfortunately, even though I had submitted the item, I was unable to correct the Title or Description and I was unable to delete the submission altogether and start again. I unkicked the post back to zero kicks but that didn't help.

My suggestion therefore, is that the submitter of an article should be able to delete that submission. Perhaps, to be safe, it could be restricted to only allow deletion if no one else has kicked it.

Until then, I'll just have to live with looking stupid for [my story](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/tipsandtricks/Deleting_old_temp_files_with_PowerShell) on DotNetKicks which, strangely, someone other than me has kicked anyway.
