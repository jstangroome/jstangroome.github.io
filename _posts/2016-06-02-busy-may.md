In January I presented at the [Sydney ALT.NET user group](http://sydney.ozalt.net/) about HTTPS, focusing on all the new advancements in this space and some long-held misconceptions too. It was well received so I re-presented it at the [Port80 Sydney meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Port80-Sydney/) in March. I met Steve Cassidy from Macquarie University who was also presenting at the same Port80 meetup and I was invited to present the talk a third time as a guest lecture to second year Macquarie University Computer Science students on May 4th. The lecture was filmed but is only available to those with a student login. My [slide deck from Port80 is available on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/https-presentation-at-port80-sydney-meetup) though. On May 19th I delivered a [breakfast talk](http://www.meetup.com/Azure-Sydney-User-Group/events/230501348/) about my experience deploying some of section.io's infrastructure into Azure. The [video of this talk is publicly available](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_tRUzerXZw) and so are [the slides](http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/sectionio-expanding-from-aws-to-azure). This year my friend [Aaron lead the organising of the return of the DDD conference in Sydney](http://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2016-06-01-dddsydney-what-i-learnt-organising-the-conference.html). I submitted a talk proposal and was fortunate to receive enough votes to earn a speaking slot. So, on Saturday May 28th I presented "Web Performance Lessons" which covered a variety of scenarios I had encountered while improving the performance of other people's websites as part of my job at section.io. The talk was recorded by the conference sponsor [SSW](https://tv.ssw.com/) and is [available to watch here](https://tv.ssw.com/6754/web-performance-lessons-from-other-peoples-websites-jason-stangroome-at-ddd-sydney-2016). Also [my slides can be viewed at SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/web-performance-lessons-at-ddd-sydney-may-2016). At the Port80 meetup in March I also met [Mo Badran](https://twitter.com/mbadran) who organises the [Operational Intelligence Sydney meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Operational-Intelligence/). Mo asked if I could do a presentation of how section.io handles operations so on Tuesday May 31st I presented "Monitoring at section.io" where I shared a bunch of detail about our tools and processes for operational visibility at section.io, both for the platform itself, and for users of our CDN. Those [slides are published on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/JasonStangroome/monitoring-at-sectionio-operational-intelligence-meetup-may-2016) too. I'll take a break from speaking in June and instead absorb what other people have to share at the [Velocity conference](http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity) in Santa Clara and take the opportunity to also check out the new section.io office in Colorado. I know this blog has been quiet for a while. I have been posting most of my written content over at the [section.io blog](https://www.section.io/blog/) lately and will probably continue to blog there more often than here in the near future. Some of my recent posts include:
    * [Reducing the risk of change](https://www.section.io/2016/04/14/reducing-the-risk-of-change.html)
    * [Contributing back to the community](https://www.section.io/2016/04/21/contributing-back-to-the-community.html)
    * [A little help improving your website's transport security](https://www.section.io/2016/05/09/improving-your-websites-transport-security.html)
