I have another weekend driving holiday planned in the next few weeks and my fiancee has requested Family Guy episodes on the iPod for the trip. Now that I know how to do it, I figure I better get started because there are a [lot of episodes](http://www.tv.com/family-guy/show/348/episode.html).

This time I decided to try Vrata's suggestion of [DVDFab](http://www.dvdfab.com/) instead of the Videora software I used [last time](http://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,b501336c-366b-47fe-b698-1c5ee2df5bac.aspx). What follows is a very quick summary of my experience with DVDFab.

Benefits:

* Does not require separate DVD ripping software.
* Supports optionally embedding subtitles into the video stream.
* GUI is very clean and easy to follow.
* Hasn't crashed yet on Vista x64.

Disappointments:

* Still insists on running as Administrator.
* The Platinum version for iPod conversion costs about US$50.

In all other ways DVDFab is similar to Videora. Similar conversion times, same resulting file sizes. Support for multiple devices' resolutions and bit rates.

If you think you'll be converting quite a lot of DVDs to an iPod compatible format, DVDFab is probably worth the price and you can try the fully-functional 30-day trial yourself to be sure.
