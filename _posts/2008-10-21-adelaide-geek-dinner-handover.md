As I have recently accepted a new job interstate, I will no longer be organising dinners for fellow developers in Adelaide. However, rather than allow such a fun event to disappear, I am passing the awesome responsibility of organising the dinners to my friend and colleague, [Jim Burger](http://nervoustych.com/blog/), whom many of you have met on previous occasions.

I will be giving Jim a hard time to make sure he continues to arrange a dinner at least once each quarter and I believe it will also help to ensure he remembers to attend them himself ;). Names and contact details of previous attendees and people who have registered their interest will be given to Jim so he can send you the next invite but let him or I know if you'd rather be removed from the list.

If you've never been invited to an Adelaide Geek Dinner before but want to be on the list, just contact Jim or I and you'll surely be invited to the next one.
