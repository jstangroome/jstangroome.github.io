I installed VS2008 Beta 2 on a spare machine on the weekend and I am beginning to use it for development. Today I waded through the Tools, Options dialog setting up the IDE with a few sensible defaults. Several default values have changed since VS2005 and for the better. Unfortunately two settings are still outdated.

VB still defaults Option Strict to Off whilst Option Explicit and the new Option Infer are On. They should all be on by default.

Also, when the new range of Microsoft fonts were released for Vista and Office, an [update for VS2005](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&displaylang=en) was released to use the new Consolas type in the IDE. VS2008 still defaults to the non-ClearType Courier New though.

Aside from those two issues so far, I'm loving the new Visual Studio.
